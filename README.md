## üéØ Why I Built It?

It all started when I was working on the [sheikh-othman-platform](https://github.com/heynzar/sheikh-othman-platform) project that needed a sidebar, a simple component that could adapt to different layouts, screen sizes, and user needs.

One day, while using Todoist to organize my tasks, I realized how much I admired their sidebar. It was clean, intuitive, and just worked smoothly. That‚Äôs when the idea hit me: What if I could recreate something just as functional and beautiful, but flexible enough for anyone to use in their projects?

**I wanted to challenge myself to build this component from scratch‚Äîno shortcuts**. it was about creating something developers could trust and users would love.

This project became more than just a sidebar, it was a way to refine my skills in React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, while also creating a tool I knew others would find valuable. **It‚Äôs a journey of solving a problem, learning, and sharing a solution with the world.**
